# Pathfinding Visualizer

This project is a React-based web application that visualizes the pathfinding process using algorithms like Dijkstra's. It allows you to create walls, set start and finish points, and visualize the algorithm finding the shortest path.

## Demo
You can try the Pathfinding Visualizer live [here](#).

## Features
- Visualize Dijkstra's algorithm for pathfinding.
- Create walls by clicking and dragging on the grid.
- Reset the grid to the initial state.
- Animate the pathfinding process, including the shortest path found.

## Technologies Used
- React
- JavaScript
- CSS

## Setup
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/pathfinding-visualizer.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd pathfinding-visualizer
    ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
4. **Start the development server:**
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

## Usage
1. **Open the application in your browser:**
    - The development server will open the application in your default browser. If it doesn't, navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

2. **Visualize Dijkstra's Algorithm:**
    - Click the "Visualize Dijkstra's Algorithm" button to see the algorithm in action.

3. **Reset the Grid:**
    - Click the "Reset" button to clear the grid and start over.

4. **Create Walls:**
    - Click and drag on the grid to create walls that the algorithm will navigate around.
